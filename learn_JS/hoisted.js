// In JavaScript, hoisting is a behavior where variable and function declarations are moved to the top of their containing scope during the compilation phase. This means that you can use functions and variables before they are declared in the code. However, it's important to note that only the declarations are hoisted, not the initializations.
name();

function name(){
    console.log("ABDUL MOIZ");
